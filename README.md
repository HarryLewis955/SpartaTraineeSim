## How to use the project

## Sprints
### Sprint 1
The first sprint was making the core loop of the project. We created a trello board to keep track of what we were working on and what was coming up and starting drafting a testing plan.
### Sprint 2
The main core looop was create but it was not ready to be tested, so refactoring took place for this sprint. During this stage we set up a MCV model, and started outputting the information. 
### Sprint 3
Incorporating the new information from day 2 into the loop and the refactorting was the main aim for the sprint. Testing began on the main core loop. The information given from day 3 was started on but not added to the main loop yet.
### Sprint 4
Adding in the information from day 3 into the main loop was the main part of the day, as well as testing it and improving testing on the previous information. This was the main sprint for cleaning up the code, and making small improvements.

## Dependanices
## Epics
